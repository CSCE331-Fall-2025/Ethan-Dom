    <p>I've volunteered at my local animal shelter multiple times over the length of my senior year in high school. With duties consisting of giving the dogs their enrichment item for the day, cleaning up yesterday's enrichment if needed, and preparing an enrichment item for the following day. I made use of any time I wasn't doing this, helping staff members at the shelter with various duties such as getting the dogs in/out of their pens for cleaning, organizing the shelves and washing/folding laundry. Volunteers at the shelter worked in teams of two, though the shelter was often understaffed and I ended up by myself. When I was not by myself I was helping a new volunteer with learning the ropes.
    Overall my time at the animal shelter has helped me develop my communication skills when I chatted with the staff and trained new volunteers. As well as organizational skills in planning the dogs next days and cleaning the shelter.
