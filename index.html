    <p class="index-bio">
    Hello, I'm Ethan Dominguez, a junior at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html">Texas A&M University</a> at <a href="https://www.tamug.edu">Galveston</a> majoring in Computer Science. 
    Which I've been interested in since early high school with the Computer Science teacher there and my friends being 
    enthusiastic about it. After dipping my toes into the subject in the first class I ended up enjoying it a lot, 
    especially the logical thinking and freedom you have in coding. The rest of high school I was incredibly engaged in 
    the class and finally found what I was hoping to pursue in college. Of course, I've been successful in that pursuit so 
    far and am hoping I can keep going with it for a long time. My extracurriculars include being in the Computer Science 
    and Asian Diversity clubs, an officer for the Gaming club, and volunteering at my local animal shelter. These extra 
    curriculars helped me learn more about what I was interested in as well as the world and the people in it. Helping me 
    meet people and ideas that I wouldn't have otherwise and really got me to get out of my shell and become better 
    at talking to people, especially strangers. I also participated in organizations such as National Technical Honor 
    Society and Mu Alpha Theta, from these I learned to love learning from being able to pick what I learned instead of 
    having to meet requirements and classes for school. Another thing about me is I love animals, most of all animals in 
    this world. If I wasn't doing Computer Science, I would probably be trying to get a job at my animal shelter, the zoo, 
    or as a veterinarian. Growing up my family has had many animals, dogs, cats, ferrets, fish, lizards, and mantises. 
    While none of them are incredibly exotic I still enjoyed learning how to care for each and every one and love them all.
